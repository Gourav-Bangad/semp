well a very good evening to you from the
Fortuna arena in Prague czechia take on
Portugal and intriguingly in group A2
League a group two both these sides
still have a chance of making it through
to the finals but both could yet be
relegated from this group all still to
play for great atmosphere
foreign
Portugal get us underway
what are we looking for in the early
stages here Andy Hinchcliffe I think
Portugal I think Stephen Cristiano are
trying to get his team fired up they
will very much be on the front foot
expect them to dominate the ball so even
though the checks are at home very
vitally important they don't concede an
early goal because Portugal with a bit
between their teeth are a team with the
attackers that they have can cause you
problems right from the off
take the corner Ronaldo makes to near
Post Run that's a good punch from bats
League only as far as Bernardo Silva I
think Carvalho to drag it back across
and in the end it's fired just wide by
Ruben Diaz
that's a bit of unsure defending choice
David seamer as a
intelligent ball is played there from
Leonardo Silva he actually gets in the
way but doesn't really clear his lines
he gets his feet in a bit of a mix up
there and that presents the chance to DS
such an intelligent class from Bernardo
Silva how many times we've seen that
it's the right option
he's Antonin Barrack if they convert
this into something this is goal of the
season so far but it goes wrong
so far with a terrific ball in and
Barrack heads wide
check here have come to the party
absolutely again you can have a
philosophy of playing out for the back
but putting it into practice against the
high pressing team not easy just wonder
here where the Barack and chick actually
get in each other's way
It's a Wonderful ball in a really
considered ball in
I just wonder whether Barrack doesn't
maybe see that until a little bit too
late and just completely mistimes the
header that's the problem he's not
marred by anybody
he just completely mistimes it he keeps
it on target
[Applause]
nothing really in a game that Portugal
as we said at the start have to win
really they both do
both on the front foot here's Bruno
Fernandez to roll that through Raphael
arriving
and then
[Applause]
download
coming in from that right hand side to
slide it home
he's under pressure he's been closed
down but he backs himself and he just
steps forward but the important thing is
when he plays the forward pass he then
becomes an attacker he doesn't just
think well I'm a fullback I'll just stay
in my own half he plays the forward ball
and then he follows it he gets himself
into a goal scoring position
he looks as though Ronaldo's going to
score layout does incredibly well to
pull this ball back but look at dalo's
position the right back has continued
his run is there just to turn it home
and
William Carvalho
and again Mario rui for Bruno
[Applause]
picking the pass making the run it's
just perfection from Portugal and they
do have their second goal
the checks but what they're doing is
that they're ball watching they're not
appreciating the run you can see Bruno
Fernando's edge of the Box Alex
Crowley's with him and then crowl's
focus is on the ball not on the danger
which is the forward run of Bruno
Fernandez you got to give the Portuguese
a lot of credits a wonderfully whipball
in the timing of the Run for the
midfielders excellent but his run is not
tracked he's not dealt with he hasn't
been throughout this first half and I
said it's a matter of time before he
punishes them and that second goal could
be game over wonderful ball in
this would be a good time to score
probably be the final action of the half
and ricochets through appeals for a hand
oh they all went up there the czechia
players which is offered a sign
they'll be looking at that let's see
what they do when they recycle low with
Barrack this could be a big moment
this is what he's looking at Andy
well as I say what they're looking at is
is that hand arm in a natural position
and from that defensive position is his
hand his arms should not be there so
I'll be surprised if this is not a
penalty
here's the decision
[Applause]
going into the second half
it is Chic and he blazes over
and Ronaldo's mistake is not punished
that's absolutely devastating for
checkout he had to score there
trying to re-establish that first half
rhythm
super clever turn inside and what about
the Finish
that Sleek beaten again and Portugal
piling on the pain Diego Dalo cutting
inside
it's turning into his glory day here
is they push their fullbacks forward if
they don't give the ball away cheaply
never very rarely gives the ball away
then as we see wasrael kinsella when he
plays you can step forward but this is
such a control considered finish he
actually uses the Czech players as a
screen and then the goalkeeper Vats they
could be that please maybe he should be
doing better it's not really whipped
with a huge amount of power into the
corner the keeper seems to miss time his
die so I think his reaction tells you he
knows he should be doing a bit better
but again Dalo stepping forward from
fullback on his weaker left foot doing
the right thing keeping it on target
getting some Pace on it and he gets his
rewards in three nil Portugal I just
cannot see and I'll check you are going
to turn this situation around
[Applause]
lovely balls slid forward there by
Ricardo horta who's
carried on his run here
they weren't themselves a corner and
stick to the task there that slavia
milka
and now they're getting involved in that
near post
[Applause]
the drought is over for Diogo jotta
arriving at the far post to score goal
number four for Portugal defensively as
that ball is played in
the Czech defensive line all just step
up and again so many of them watching
the ball not staying with their
opponents it's too easy there for shot
to just to drift in behind you know it's
straightforward defending
and they've been punished time and again
in this game you know an outswinging
corn ladder should be dealt with but you
don't get to that first one you've got
to react defend that second ball
and they're all moving away from the
goal they're not staying with their men
it's far too easy
to tuck that home
been played on by Chev chick wasn't he
at the near post
[Applause]
versus Ronaldo they're still hungry for
goals he certainly is
Reuben Nevis now trying to set himself
expect him to hit the corner there yeah
this is a major surprise once he's
worked the opening and the space
well check he has started this game on
the front foot tranapa Portugal under
pressure
a tale for them of mistakes made of
chances not taken Portugal's quality has
won the day
two goals surprisingly from Diogo dallow
a missed penalty from Patrick Schick
and then the score was at two nil and
then in the second half jotter rounding
things off Bruno Fernandez the other
first half goal scorer shilabi has work
to do ahead of the game against
Switzerland for Fernando Santos it's
going to be Winner Takes all it would
seem against Spain big night this for
Portugal they were under pressure
tonight and they have responded Ronaldo
not on the scoresheet but still he led
them quite brilliantly
